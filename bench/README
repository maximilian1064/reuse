1.  Please check the CFLAGS to see if I missing some optimization flags
2.  The header hbwmalloc.h is already included in the source tree, only the LIBFLAGS

3.  A script for the benchmarking are available, but missing the environment variables
    for running HermitCore applications, please add them in the script, then run it,
    that's all. Results will be stored in the files specified in the script. 
4.  All tests running 64 threads (avaliable number of cores on single KNL numa node).
5.  Target distgen-hbw is for test of hbw bandwith on HermitCore
    Target distgen-ddr is for test of ddr bandwidth on HermitCore
